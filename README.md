### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Timezzz/Timezzz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning in **FZU**
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **C and C++ language**
## My brief introduction
  As a newbie in program aera,my programming skill is rather poor,so I am here to learn more knowledge with you guys.I've just learned **C language** in the last semesterï¼ŒIt is easy to understand the basic grammer but it is hard to create a correct code that satisfy our need.
  In order to improve myself,let's start in this holiday.
  Thank you for reading this!.
